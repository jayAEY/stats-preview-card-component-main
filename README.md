## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailwindCSS](https://nextjs.org/) - CSS framework
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Frontend Build Tool

### Continued development

Although fairly simple, this was a good way to practice using Tailwind. It was also good for practicing the setup of a project with Vite. In the future I'd like to keep practicing until I get comfortable with these technologies.
